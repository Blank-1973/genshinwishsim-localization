======

The repository serves as a library module for the main app (housed on a separate repo). As such, it is structured like an Android Studio Project. The main folder or files to edit can be found at `GenshinWishSimLocalization/genshinwishsimlib/src/main/res` folder.

- To contribute to an existing language, you can modify the `strings.xml` file directly.
- To contribute a new language, you must first create the corresponding language folder. For example, if you would like to add Japanese language, you should create the `values-ja` folder, then add in the relevant `strings.xml` files.

Please take note that the number of `%s` or `%d` should be the same as the English string. If you see `%s` in the string, please also insert a `%s` in your localized string.
