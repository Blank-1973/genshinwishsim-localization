Contribute
======

The repository is structured the same as the `/res` folder in an Android Studio Project. 

- To contribute to an existing language, you can modify the `strings.xml` file directly.
- To contribute a new language, you must first create the corresponding language folder. For example, if you would like to add Japanese language, you should create the `values-ja` folder, then add in the relevant `strings.xml` files.

Please take note that the number of `%s` or `%d` should be the same as the English string. If you see `%s` in the string, please also insert a `%s` in your localized string.
